# Exploring Turtle

Review: Turtle is a Python library. It contains lots of code that has been already written by programmers, and ready for you to use! Again, the first step to use the code inside of the turtle library is to import it like so:
```
import turtle
```
Next, we want to save the turtle.Pen() function as a variable t so we don't have to type out turtle.Pen() every time we want to use code inside of turtle. For example, if I didn't type this out,
```
t = turtle.Pen()
```
then every time I want to move the turtle forward I would have to type out this:
```
turtle.Pen().forward(100)
```
By creating variable t, I have less to type out!! In the last project, we explored how to use some different functions in the turtle library (.forward(), . backward(), .left(), .right(), .clear(), .reset(), .up(), .down(), .circle(), etc.). In this project we'll learn how to use some other fun functions in turtle!!
